Still another Odin Project. This one seems to be mainly about learning how to use CSS Grid, which I've been using for a few years now. There are a few places in this code where I think flex might be a better option, but I see the point in using Grid in as many varied ways as possible. 

In addition to the assignment itself, I tried to make things responsive and accessible, though it probably needs a more thorough going-over. Also, I made the SVGs myself, from scratch, in VS Code. It's just another something I've been teaching myself in an attempt to keep the page size down, and to while away the hours between Marvel and Star Wars shows...
